Our community edition, provides many important features to experience the usability and the optimization power of Neutrino. Community edition is primarily targetted to verify the smooth integration of Neutrino into the existing process and pipeline of various products. Feel `free` to use it! The aim of the community edition is multi-fold, as follows:

- Users could hands-on experience the power and capacity of model architecture optimization achieved using ``Deeplite Neutrino``
- Users could compare the performance obtained using ``Deeplite Neutrino`` with other open-source and industry model architecture optimization frameworks
- Users could export an optimized model to test integration with their end applications
- Users could verify the integration of ``Deeplite Neutrino`` with their business-as-usual
- Users could use ``Deeplite Neutrino`` to accelerate academic research and report results in research papers
- Users could just play around with ``Deeplite Neutrino`` and enjoy the usability of model architecure optimization in various use-cases 

However, for a production stability version and to have access to some advanced features, we recommend to use the production edition of Neutrino. We recommend the productiion edition under the following scenarios:

- For using a stable and support-friendly production environment
- To optimize some advanced, state-of-art, and complex deep learning architectures for object detection and segmentation
- To export and consumed the optimized models along with its trained weights in ONNX or PyTorch JIT format
- To be able to use Neutrino in a private environment with no external internet support
