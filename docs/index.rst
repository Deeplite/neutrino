Deeplite Neutrinoâ„¢ 
==================

.. figure:: media/index_figure.png

With the emergence of deep learning on mobile and embedded devices, AI solutions must satisfy strict computing requirements,
which often limits performance and prevents people from moving to these devices. Deeplite created Neutrino,
an intelligent optimization engine for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) deployed on cloud servers and edge devices.
Neutrino helps AI experts automatically optimize high-performance DNN models to satisfy target computation constraints.
The engine inputs large, initial DNN models and constraints to produce smaller, highly-efficient models that meet these constraints.
